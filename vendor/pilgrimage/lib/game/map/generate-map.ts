 * the hovel always stands on buildable ground with breathing space, even on a
 * map whose knobs left no glade to be had.
 *
 * The branch forks from the road tile nearest the door by dry land (outside
 * the road's outer stretches) and is routed with the trail wander, steered
 * away from the road and the hovel itself so it reads as one clean track in,
 * not a tangle. Siting and forking both measure distance around water rather
 * than across it, so the hovel lands on the same bank as its junction and the
 * track stays dry; it will bridge only when no dry way exists at all.

/**
 * A* over land, 4-connected, cost 1 + wander per step. River water is crossable
 * only via a straight bridge: a run of at most `maxSpan` river tiles in one
 * direction ending on dry land, costed per bridged tile so narrow crossings
 * win. Lake water is impassable, full stop.
 *
 * `pass` is `kind` with already-built bridges knocked out to 0, so routes walk
 * existing bridges like land; a *new* crossing still has to launch from and
 * land on true land (`kind` 0), never side-on into or out of another bridge,
 * and may not run alongside one either — two straight bridges laid a tile
 * apart weld into one wide slab, so a route that wants to cross there uses
 * the bridge that already exists. That keeps every bridge a clean straight
 * segment. Returns null when no route exists (the road relaxes the span and,
 * as a last resort, falls back to blind routing; trails just skip the edge).
