/**
 * Seeded water: lakes, ponds, and rivers, generated before everything else so
 * forests and the road can react to them.
 *
 * The rules, in short:
 *  - Not every map has water. The layout (0–2 rivers, 0–1 lakes, 0–2 ponds) is
 *    rolled from the water RNG stream, and a coverage budget keeps water from
 *    dominating the map.
 *  - Rivers are 2–8 tiles wide, never dead-end inland — every end is a map
 *    edge or a lake — may branch, and carry a flow direction (into or out of
 *    their lake; edge-to-edge rivers just flow one way).
 *  - Centerlines meander along an imaginary topography: a smooth noise field
 *    rolled once per map, which every river (and branch) leans along, so the
 *    bends are long and rivers near each other curve the same way.
 *  - Rivers never cross. One that meets water already on the map ends there:
 *    at a lake it simply stops; at another river it bends downstream into it
 *    as a tributary, and the receiving river runs wider from the junction on.
 *  - Every river is pinched to a narrow width at regular intervals so the road
 *    can always find a short bridge crossing.
 *  - Wide stretches (≥ ISLAND_MIN_WIDTH) may hold small islands; narrow ones
 *    never do.
 *  - Any water body that ends up smaller than MIN_WATER_BODY tiles is removed.
 *  - Depth is distance from the nearest shore, capped at MAX depth 3.
